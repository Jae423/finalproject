
ABOUT:
For my final project, I made a website that visually aids in my capstone,
an adaptive reuse project in the Bronx. Situated on the Bronx Community College (BCC),
Gould Memorial Library is a nationally landmarked building that fell during the disinvestment
of the Bronx in 1970â€™s. To identify an optimal use for the edifice, BCC enlisted the
NYU Wagner Capstone team to research potential uses in order to create a fundraising
strategy for the building, an asset in the Bronx. The hard costs, however, of the
rehabilitation total over 50 million dollars in hard costs and 40 million dollars
projected in soft costs. Therefore, the use needs to be a compelling one for both the
students and for the community. To better understand the context of the rehabilitation
to inform our recommendations, gaining visual context of the landmarked site could be helpful
and having a comprehensive location via the website for all of this information would be
helpful as well.
